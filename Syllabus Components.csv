Office Hours,"I have an open door policy and welcome your questions and concerns. Stop in to see me or make an appointment.

Course Workload Statement,"The expectation of the University of Southern Mississippi is that students should spend approximately 2 to 3 hours outside of class each week for every hour in class working on reading, assignments, studying, and other work for the course. Time management is thus critical for student success. All students should assess their personal circumstances and talk with their advisors about the appropriate number of credit hours to take each term. Resources for academic support can be found at https://www.usm.edu/success. "
Academic Support Resources,"If a student believes that they have a disability which is covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and makes them eligible to receive classroom accommodations, they should contact the Office for Disability Accommodations (ODA) for information regarding the registration process.· Disabilities covered by the ADA may include but are not limited to ADHD, learning disabilities, psychiatric disabilities, physical disabilities, chronic health disorders, temporary illnesses or injuries and pregnancies. Students should contact ODA if they are not certain whether their documented medical condition qualifies for ODA services.
